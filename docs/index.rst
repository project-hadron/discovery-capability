Project Hadron
==============

**Project Hadron** is an open-source application framework for in-memory preprocessing
and trained model predict, where data analysis, feature optimisation and supervised
machine learning, require efficiency and speed within an ML lifecycle. With
:ref:`Apache Arrow<What is PyArrow?>` as its canonical, and a more directed use of Pandas,
**Project Hadron** offers effective data management, extensive interoperability, improved
memory management and hardware optimization.

As a concept, **Project Hadron** was conceived with a desire to improve the availability
of objective relevant data, increase the transparency and traceability of data lineage and
facilitate knowledge transfer, retrieval and reuse.

At its core **Project Hadron** is a selection of :ref:`capabilities<What are capabilities?>`
that represent an encapsulated set of actions that act upon a given set of features or
dataset.

For a more in-depth view of **Project Hadron** read the section on :ref:`Why Project Hadron?` or
jump straight to :ref:`Getting Started` once you have :ref:`installed<Installation>` the package.
