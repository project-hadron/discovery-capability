Project Hadron
==============

**Project Hadron** is an open-source application framework for in-memory preprocessing, where
data analysis, machine learning, and other data-intensive tasks require efficiency and speed.
With :ref:`Apache Arrow<What is PyArrow?>` as its canonical, and a more directed use of pandas,
**Project Hadron** offers effective data management, extensive interoperability, improved memory
management and hardware optimization.

At its concept, **Project Hadron** was conceived with a desire to improve the availability of
objective relevant data, increase the transparency and traceability of data lineage and facilitate
knowledge transfer, retrieval and reuse.

At its core **Project Hadron** is a selection of :ref:`capabilities<What are capabilities?>` that
represent an encapsulated set of actions that act upon a given set of features or dataset. An
example of this would be FeatureSelection, a capability class, encapsulating cleaning data by
removing uninformative columns.

For a more in-depth view of **Project Hadron** read the section on :ref:`Why Project Hadron?` or
jump straight to :ref:`Getting Started` once you have :ref:`installed<Installation>` the package.
