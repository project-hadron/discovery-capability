Quick Start
===========

Before we begin
---------------
Project Hadron is written in Python_. If you're new to the language you might want to start by
getting an idea of what the language is like, to get the most out of this package.

If you're already familiar with other languages, and want to learn Python quickly, the
`Python Tutorial`_ is a good resource.

If you're new to programming and want to start with Python, the following books may be useful
to you:

* `Automate the Boring Stuff With Python`_

* `How To Think Like a Computer Scientist`_

* `Learn Python 3 The Hard Way`_

You can also take a look at `this list of Python resources for non-programmers`_, as well as
the `suggested resources in the learnpython-subreddit`_.
