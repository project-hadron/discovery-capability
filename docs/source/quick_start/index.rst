Getting Started
===============

The best way to get started is to walk through a couple of use case that take us from
raw data to model predict, then onto a capability pipeline. The two use case are both
classification challenges, with the first using the titanic dataset to show each
capability and the second, a more real world situation of customer churn.

Following each use case is the re-usable pipeline where the capability recipes
have been placed on a remote repository. We create a new synthetic dataset and
run it through the remote pipeline.

* **use case one**: Using the Titanic dataset, predict if a passenger is likely to survive.
* **use case one remote**: run the predict pipeline as a reusable service.
* **use case two**: Using a customer banking dataset, predict customer churn.
* **use case two remote**: run the churn pipeline as a reusable service.
