Simulation
----------

According to Benjamin Schumann, a well-known simulation expert, Simulation is
process-driven while ML is data-centric. To produce good Simulation, we need to
understand the process and underlying principles of a system. In contrast, we can create
reasonably good predictions using ML by only using data from a data warehouse and some
out-of-box algorithms.
