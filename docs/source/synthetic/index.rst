Synthetic Data
==============

Simulation
----------

According to Benjamin Schumann, a well-known simulation expert, Simulation is
process-driven while ML is data-centric. To produce good Simulation, we need to
understand the process and underlying principles of a system. In contrast, we can create
reasonably good predictions using ML by only using data from a data warehouse and some
out-of-box algorithms.

The challenge of raw data
-------------------------

Every machine learning life cycle encounters some, if not all, of the problems listed
here:

- A lack of available training data, often due to privacy regulations
- Missing or imbalanced data, which will impact the quality of the downstream machine
learning model
- Biased data, which will impact the fairness of the downstream machine learning model
- Data drift, which will impact model performance over time
- Inability to share models or results due to privacy concerns

The roll of Synthetic data
--------------------------

Synthetic data can address key pain points in any machine learning life cycle. This is
because synthetic data can overcome limitations of the original, raw data collected from
‘the real world’. Specifically, synthetic data can be highly available, balanced, and
unbiased.

You can improve the quality of your machine learning life cycle by using synthetic data
to:

- Generate sufficient training data without privacy concerns
- Improve data quality through smart imputation and synthetic re-balancing
- Improve data fairness by removing embedded biases
- Boost model accuracy through training sample generation and data updates
- Share and explain AI models without infringing on privacy regulations
